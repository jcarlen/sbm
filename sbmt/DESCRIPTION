Title: Fit time-dependent stochastic blockmodels with options for degree corrected, directed, and weighted networks
Description: Rcpp package to implement the time-dependent discrete stochastic block model (TDD-SBM) we introduce in ??. 
  This package builds off the KLOptimization code of Karrer and Newman, 
  using a direct extension of the Kergnighan-Lin algorithm for multilayer (specifically time-sliced) networks. 
  However, the package is more general than fitting TDD-SBM, 
  as it can also fit undirected networks, with or without degree correction, 
  with or without multiple layers (time slices), and with any type of non-negative edge weights.
