Rcpp package to implement the time-dependent discrete stochastic block model (TDD-SBM) we introduce in ["Role detection in bicycle-sharing networks using multilayer stochastic block models"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/network-science/article/role-detection-in-bicyclesharing-networks-using-multilayer-stochastic-block-models/5D73728650C5C3E2DB9455FCDF46F0E2). This package builds off the KLOptimization code of Karrer and Newman, using a direct extension of the Kergnighan-Lin algorithm for multilayer (specifically time-sliced) networks. However, the package is more general than fitting TDD-SBM, as it can also fit undirected networks, with or without degree correction, with or without multiple layers (time slices), and with any type of non-negative edge weights.
