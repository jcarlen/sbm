\title{Convert time-sliced edgelist to time-sliced adjacency matrix (helper for likelihood functions)}
\usage{
edgelist_to_adj(edgelist, selfedges = TRUE, as.array = TRUE,
  directed = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{edgelist}{A (time) series of network data represented as a list of edgelists. Assumes all edgelist slices have same names and number of columns, first two columns designate "from" and "to" for edges and third, if present, is count.}

\item{selfedges}{If true, include self-edges in edgelist in converted adjacency matrix. If false, diagonal of adjaceny matrix is zero.}

\item{as.array}{If true, return an N x N x Time array instead of a list of adjacency matrices.}

\item{directed}{Are the edges in the edgelist directed?}
