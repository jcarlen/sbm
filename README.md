sbm

Rcpp package for stochastic block modeling, allowing for degree corrected (or not) sbm, directed (or not) networks, and non-negative edge weights. Similar code can be accessed as standalone c++ (KLOptimization_directed.cpp - see its comments for implementation details). Code adapted/extended from Karrer & Newman 2010 (http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/dcsbm/)

To install:
In terminal, from folder containing sbm > R CMD build sbm; R CMD check sbm; R CMD install sbm

This package is a work in progress and any suggestions for improvements or found bugs are appreciated.
